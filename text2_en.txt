Together, you represent the harmony between tradition and progress.

Moreover, the sweeping change brought by modernity and globalization led many Muslims to view the West as hostile to the traditions of Islam.

This has bred more fear and mistrust.

This cycle of suspicion and discord must end.

As the Holy Koran tells us, "Be conscious of God and speak always the truth."

Islamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires; timeless poetry and cherished music; elegant calligraphy and places of peaceful contemplation.

That experience guides my conviction that partnership between America and Islam must be based on what Islam is, not what it isn't. And I consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.

We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words – within our borders, and around the world.

Moreover, freedom in America is indivisible from the freedom to practice one's religion. That is why there is a mosque in every state of our union, and over 1,200 mosques within our borders.

So let there be no doubt: Islam is a part of America. And I believe that America holds within her the truth that regardless of race, religion, or station in life, all of us share common aspirations – to live in peace and security; to get an education and to work with dignity; to love our families, our communities, and our God. These things we share. This is the hope of all humanity.

In Ankara, I made clear that America is not – and never will be – at war with Islam. We will, however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security.

The situation in Afghanistan demonstrates America's goals, and our need to work together.

It is costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict.

There is no such thing, at this stage of the world’s history in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dare write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinions out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my papers, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance.

It's all about sentences. Not words.

You can search sentences containing a certain word and get translations for these sentences.

Why sentences? …you may ask. Well, because sentences are more interesting.

Sentences bring context to the words. Sentences have personalities. They can be funny, smart, silly, insightful, touching, hurtful.

Allow me to help.

Are you an active member of the union?

Ask for me and you will be admitted.

Can you come this afternoon or tomorrow afternoon?

Can you see me after supper?

Children must be accompanied by adults.

Come and see me afterwards.

Could you advance me some money?

Did you all go?

Do you like adventure stories?

Do you need anything in addition?

Do you sell alarm clocks?

Don't act like a child.

Don't be alarmed. He's not hurt badly.

Don't let people take advantage of you.

During his administration a great many new laws were passed.

Everyone knows of his affection for that dog.

Go ahead and tell him if you want to.

Go ahead and write your letter. I'll wait.

Has any action been taken on my case?

He acted on your suggestion.

He agreed to your terms.

He always affects indifference when you mention her.

He can't afford to have his reputation hurt.

He forgot it again.

He handled the affairs of the company badly.

How much is the admission?

How much should I allow for travel expenses?

How much will you allow me for this?

How should he be addressed, "citizen" or "comrade?"

I admire his wit.

I can't adjust myself to the climate here.

I can't adopt your view.

I couldn't do this all alone.

I couldn't invite him. We're not well acquainted.

I don't want to miss the first act.

I feel more dead than alive.

I have no acquaintance with court procedure.

I hope my partner can come to an agreement with you.

I kept the fire alive all night.

I know her, but I'm not acquainted with the rest of the family.

I was here two months ago.

I wasn't a bit affected by the news of his death.

I wish to take advantage of your offer.

I'll be there before eight, if at all.

I'll see you the day after tomorrow.

I'm afraid it's too late.

I'm ahead in my work.

I'm going out for some fresh air.

I'm in complete agreement with everything he said.

I'm leaving in the afternoon.

I've been waiting for you all day.

If that's so, all the better.

In addition to my other worries, this has to happen.

Is everyone against him?

Is everyone agreeable to the plan?

Is it all over?

Is there anyone to look after the children?

Is your aim good?

It may be advisable to go later.

It may prove to be a risky adventure.

It will take an act of Congress to change that law.

Lean it against the wall.

Let me know in advance if you are coming.

My advice to you is to leave immediately.

Never again will I make that mistake.

Who is to blame?

A thick fog blanketed the city.

To begin with, we don't have enough money.

Do you have any beans in your garden?

I postponed my trip because of the bad weather.

I was wakened by a beam of light shining through my window.

If Tom were older, he'd understand.

It would have been better if you had waited yesterday.

Let the matter rest for the time being.

Let's get our bearings before we go any further.

Mary is still a beautiful woman.

Mary is a real beauty.

Your friend said he would call back.

To call the elevator, push the button.

Half the camp went on a hike.

Has Mary cleaned the room yet?

I couldn't think of doing anything like that.

Try to keep a clear head.

We can't use this table because a leg has come off.

We'll leave as soon as the weather clears up.

We're the only ones who know the combination to the safe.

What time is it by your clock?

Why not come and have supper with us tonight?

Would you mind clearing up a few points for me?

She didn't even say thanks.

We have friends coming over this evening.

What's come over you?

When does the magazine come out?

Who knows what all this will come to.

Who's in command of this unit?

Tom is preparing supper.

Tom shouted at Mary.

When I arrived, the dispute had reached its boiling point.

Are the arrangements for your trip complete?

Be sure to complete the work before you go home.

Everything Tom predicted came true.

I'm not concerned with the details.

I can't conceive of Tom doing that.

I want a complete list of your books.

I'm expecting company this evening.

If it annoys you so much, file a complaint.

It's hard for me to concentrate today.

Mary is showing a great deal of concern over her husband's long absence.

Nothing was said concerning the matter.

The operation was very serious, but Tom came through.

The five brothers worked together on the farm.

I work in a flower shop.

She loves flowers and plants.

I have no idea what I am doing.

I have a toothache.

My French teacher is the same age as I am.

If I make a mistake, it only shows you I am not a machine.

I'm sure we'll get along.

I'm sure that I'm right.

This dictionary is completely useless.

The granny gave me a shove and dashed to the door.

Tom is asleep in his room.

Her room is in the other house.

What country were you born in?

Who is conducting the orchestra tonight?

Is Tom an American too?

Do any of you know Tom?

Have any of you ever talked to Tom?

Have any of you ever met Tom?

It seems that everybody is an American.

Is there anybody who's not an American?

I think a translator may venture to be somewhat flexible.

I know you have a house in Hawaii.

I also know that you have always wanted to learn French.

I know that some of your students don't like you.

I know that some of your students don't like you.

I like them both.

Is Tom also studying French?

Tom and Mary both looked at John.

A few seconds ago I was in the open air and the bright daylight, and now my eyes refuse to serve me in this darkness.

I must get my hair cut.

I think that'll cover all Tom's expenses.

Mary always says such cute things.

The job will take only five days, if we cut corners.

The movie had to be cut in several places.

These prices will be cut next month.

If you act like a child, you'll be treated like a child.

Patriotism in its simple, clear and plain meaning is nothing else for the rulers as an instrument to achieve the power-hungry and self-serving purposes, and for managed people it is a denial of human dignity, reason, conscience, and slavish submission of themselves to those who are in power.

Even your silence can be a part of prayer.

Hi, Tom.

On a bad road like this, I can't do more than thirty kilometers an hour.

I'm sorry, the manager won't be able to see you. He's engaged.

I'd have been here sooner except for some trouble on the way.

I like the book pretty well except for the two last chapters.

The pilot lost control and the plane went into a dive.

The city is divided into ten administrative districts.

If we can't get fresh fruit, we'll have to do without.

Have you had enough or do you want to fight some more?

I don't feel that my endeavors have been appreciated.

They plan to do away with most of these regulations.

It won't do us any harm if we talk the matter over.

I've always written home every week and I still do.

I have made a careful examination of the situation.

Will you entertain the guests while I get dressed?

It's getting hard for them to make both ends meet.

Tom's commissions often exceed his weekly salary.

They came in dog-tired after sightseeing all day.

If they got caught, they'd have to do five years.

They're having a diving contest this afternoon.

It won't do any good to complain to the police.

What division of the company do you work in?

We need an electrical engineer for this job.

Mary divorced her husband several years ago.

If Tom becomes insulting, show him the door.

Are you still hungry or have you had enough?

You ought to set an example for the others.

Tom works harder now than he did last year.

Tom has been engaged in politics for years.

There's a distinct difference between them.

Do you think this is the right thing to do?

There is a ditch on each side of the road.

The children haven't studied division yet.

No matter what you say, I did see the man.

It takes Mary a whole hour to do her hair.

In ten minutes, the potatoes will be done.

The engineer brought the train to a stop.

That has nothing to do with the question.

My pen won't work. What did you do to it?

If the boss finds this out, I'm done for.

I'll do my best to have it ready on time.

I hope you enjoyed yourself at the party.

Have you seen any English travelers here?

A few loose ends remain to be cleared up.

What did you do before you got this job?

I'd like to visit some waterfront dives.

Everything was fine, except the weather.

I don't want to be disturbed until ten.

"Did you buy the ticket?" "Yes, I did."

Tom entered the room without knocking.

The town is in a mountainous district.

Please put an end to this quarreling.

Let's ditch these people and go home.

I'll pay you at the end of the month.

I can't leave before the job is done.

Someone has disturbed all my papers.

Most of these products are domestic.

A vacation will do you lots of good.

The ship flashed a distress signal.

Tom is an excellent tennis player.

Tom is a distant relative of mine.

The room is full of odds and ends.

They dove in one after the other.

Don't you think we ought to wait?

Are you done with these scissors?

Why doesn't Tom like this hotel?

Tom is a personal enemy of mine.

I'd rather not do domestic work.

I just can't endure it any more.

I do wish we could finish today.

Has the doctor examined you yet?

Do you think this color will do?

Do you feel more encouraged now?

You'd better do as you're told.

Tom does all his work at night.

Is there a doctor in the house?

How's Tom doing at his new job?

Could I help you do the dishes?

Are you done with the book yet?

When does the performance end?

Tom gets up early and so do I.

The dining room has two doors.

Tom seems very distant today.

That was an excellent dinner.

How can you endure such cold?

Could you give me an example?

When did you enter the army?

Please open the door for me.

I've finally got my divorce.

I don't want to trouble you.

Who is entered in the race?

Tom has done his work well.

Tom encouraged our efforts.

Take this one, for example.

I've just hired a new maid.

I enjoyed myself very much.

Divide the money among you.

The train has two engines.

Don't you think I'm right?

Don't lean out the window.

Do you like the food here?

Have you fed the dog yet?

Under the Tatoeba guidelines, it is recommended that members only add sentences in their native language and/or translate from a language they can understand into their native language. The reason for this is that it is much easier to form natural-sounding sentences in one's native language. When we write in a language other than our native language, it is very easy to produce sentences that sound strange. Please make sure you only translate the sentence if you are sure you know what it means.

Please read the instructions.

Please listen to reason.

Please file a written request.

Our relations with our director are excellent.

Our receipts for the month will just pay these expenses.

Our college won't admit Tom until he meets all the requirements.

Only a few drops of rain have fallen.

Nothing else remains to be done.

Not a ray of light could reach the closet.

No one recognized Tom's genius while he was alive.

My watch needs only minor repairs.

My father flew into a rage when he found that out.

Mary reminds me of my mother.

Mary raised five children.

Many new reforms have been brought about recently.

Look what a long reach Tom has.

Limit your remarks to three minutes.

Let's not quarrel about this.

Let the matter rest for a while.

Keep a careful record of all expenses.

Just being in Tom's company is enough to ruin Mary's reputation.

It's rather cold on deck.

It's quite clear that Tom is going to be late.

It's out of the question for me to leave my job.

It's about time the manager was removed.

It's a regular madhouse here.

It's a puzzle to me how such a stupid guy ever got through college.

It was a real pleasure to meet Tom.

It was a race to get to the station on time.

It reads like a fairy tale.

It rained hard during the morning.

Is this the latest model cash register?

Is this seat reserved?

Is this real silk?

Is there regular bus service to the town?

Is there a special rate for this tour?

In what respect is that true?

In that regard, I agree with you.

In one respect, I agree with you.

If you want a ticket, please raise your hand.

If you don't remind me, I'll forget.

If you can't exchange this, I'd like a refund.

If they won't listen to reason, we'll have to resort to force.

I've read somewhere that it's not true.

I've heard a report that you're leaving Boston.

I've been tormented by regret.

I've always regretted not having traveled.

I'm sure Tom will reform.

I'm reminded of an amusing story.

I'm ready to forgive Tom.

I'm quite satisfied with Tom's answer.

I'll try to reason it out.

I'll report on this matter tomorrow.

I'll remember you in my will.

I'll have to resign myself to being alone while you're away.

I'll be there as quick as I can.

I'll be ready to go in ten minutes.

I'd rather have ice cream.

I won't be able to remit the balance until the first of the month.

I want to go on record as being against it.

I rented an apartment next to yours.

I refuse to reply to these charges.

I recommend that you take a vote.

I recognize Tom by voice.

I racked my brains for a new idea for an article.

I question the sincerity of Tom's speech.

I prefer to refrain from discussing religion.

I offered Tom a drink of vodka, but he refused it.

I live quite near here.

I live in a quiet neighborhood.

I know the reason you said that.

I just got a few interesting books on religion.

I invested all my money and then found out their business was a racket.

I have reason to think that we'll never see Tom again.

I have no regrets for what I've done.

I had a jack, a king and three queens in my hand.

I found Tom very reserved.

I feel quite put out about it.

I ducked just in time to avoid the punch aimed at me.

I don't see any relation between the two problems.

I don't know the introduction, but I can sing the refrain.

I don't have much ready money.

I don't feel well and would rather stay at home today.

I didn't realize you were interested in it.

I didn't realize how serious the situation was.

I didn't know you were related.

I didn't have the strength or resolution to argue with Tom.

I didn't expect such a nasty response to my question.

I cut myself with the razor.

I copied down several useful references on gardening.

I consider Tom a thoroughly responsible individual.

I can't figure out the reason why Tom did it.

I can refer you to a good book on this subject.

I can give two of my former teachers as references.

I am writing you at the request of a friend.

How much rent do you pay for the apartment?

How long did it take you to recover from your operation?

How large а sum did they raise?

How did Tom respond to that news?

Hold on to the rail while going down these stairs.

Here's your money. Now we're quits.

He's represented us in Congress for years.

Have you signed the register?

Have you read your mail yet?

Have you been invited to the reception?

Have you any references from your other employers?

Have some respect for other people's opinions.

Give my regards to your sister.

Give me a red pencil.

Give me a reading on that meter near the boiler.

Everything in life is relative.

During whose reign was that church built?

Don't you realize your behavior reflects on all of us?

Don't worry. We can remedy the mistake we've made.

Don't try to reform everyone you meet.

Don't repeat what I've told you.

Don't raise your voice above a whisper.

Don't do it if you care for your reputation.

Do you think Tom resembles his mother?

Do you think their wages ought to be raised?

Do you require a deposit?

Do you remember when Tom said that?

Do you like your steak rare?

Do you know the real facts?

Do you have many jazz records?

Do you have a radio here?

Crude oil is refined at this plant.

Complaining won't remedy the situation.

Can you solve these puzzles?

Can you recommend a good hotel?

Can you reach the sugar on the top shelf?

Can you quote me a price for the house?

Bring your racket and we'll play some tennis.

Be sure to register the letter.

Be sure to get a receipt when you deliver the package.

At the dance, everyone raved about my gown.

As a last resort, we can stay at my sister's.

After much reflection, I decided not to accept the offer.

A new railroad will soon be laid here.

A little rest would do you a lot of good.

A light rain made the sidewalks wet.

Sparks rained on the street from the burning house.

I'm fed up with waiting for you.

Ripe bananas have the yellow colour.

Where's the key? Ah, you have it.

You're a disgrace to this family!

Northern lights appear all year round in Greenland.

What if something went wrong?

We need to get rid of the guards.

I won't leave without you.

How will I scour with a fork?

- Go to work, scour the shit. - Screw you!

Are you nuts or what?

Cum was pouring, there was a lot of cum.

It was so hot in Australia yesterday that Tom managed to fry an egg on a shovel.

The students acted in an inappropriate manner.

The cold weather is expected to last until the weekend.

Were there any customers while I was gone?

Party time!

This is what I like about him.

This is what I like about her.

Tom sounded slightly panicked.

This is what I like about you.

A fire broke out on the second floor of the building.

It's good to have you home.

Impossible things happen that we can't understand. They're completely unimaginable.

He's not an unreasonable man.

He's prideful and arrogant.

Do you think there's a hell?

She's a fine looking woman.

Please, Mary, you can't break up with me!

Please, Tom, you can't break up with me!

Yes, I can break up with you. I just did.

He knocked my books out of my hands!

There's something that I've been wanting to say to you for a long time.

The public's fascination with organized crime is very disturbing.

I don't understand why people idolize criminals.

I'm sure Tom can speak French.

I'm not as slim as my older sister.

In Esperanto a stress falls on the penultimate syllable.

Now I've got some time.

Why did he buy another car?

His mother discreetly kept an eye on the boy.

After the calves are weaned they are moved to the plush river-flats for fattening.

He caught me staring at him and I blushed.

How could you do this to us?

Tom jumped out of a moving car.

Tom jumped into the car and drove away.

Tom stopped at a convenience store to get a drink.

Tom's cat is always waiting at the door when he arrives home.

Tom hasn't been charged.

Tom was told he would never amount to anything, and he was desperate to prove them wrong.

Tom and Mary have three grown children and two grandchildren.

Tom has been seeing a therapist for a month and a half.

You should see a therapist.

You might need professional help.

I like to visit cemeteries. Is that normal?

I like to visit cemeteries when I travel.

The children are flying kites.

I'm addicted to what I do.

Do you really think you can get away with this?

The climate here is warm for most of the year.

Tom always wanted to be a teacher.

I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I enjoyed writing it.

Most students can speak English.

I'm stronger than yesterday.

I didn't notice anything suspicious.

Many people did not want to believe that this story was made up.

Do you understand what that means?

The shop won't be open for clients tomorrow.

If you jumbled "Tokyo", you could get "Kyoto".

I've just watched a video on how to bake a sumptuous blueberry pie.

The firefighter is talking about the fire.

Tom is driving to the hospital.

The firefighters are trying to put out the flames.

The firefighters are trying to put out the flames.

"Kyoto" is an anagram of "Tokyo."

Does Tom go to the same school as Mary?

I don't want to work at a fast-food place forever.

There weren't any other elephants around.

The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.

A clever husband reads his wife's thoughts, but doesn't try to understand them.

We'll meet her tomorrow at the station.

You were cheated.

Creaking cars reach the furthest.

Was this letter written by Mary?

We should tell the children how to defend oneself.

Not all philosophers consider the endlessness of the Universe to be true.

You should smile sometimes.

He was lying by intent.

He lied by intent.

Tom got in a burning car and burned.

Several ships are stuck in sea ice in Antarctica.

It's getting beyond a joke!

This year I most definitely have to drive.

How can I improve my English skill?

Mary lost her favorite pen.

Tom was full of remorse after stealing Mary's car and writing it off.

That sounds about right.

He's clever and resourceful.

After thoroughly examining Mary, the doctor could find no physical reason for her condition, and concluded that the cause was psychosomatic.

Tom's beer froze because of the cold.

Beware of frostbite!

After experiencing several acute psychotic episodes, Mary was admitted to a mental institution.

My dog is an Alaskan malamute, not a husky.

Huskies love cold weather.

I am fully aware of Tom's activities.

I'm not questioning your competence.

I didn't realize the importance of that problem.

Some dogs love being outdoor.

He's having dinner now.

He's not quite satisfied.

He didn't go to study because of his disease.

Last time he told me he'd lend me that book the next day

There are only three days left.

Maybe that's just what he wants you to believe.

He's manipulating you!

We don't have time to argue about this.

I wish things could have been different.

Mary is a manipulative control freak.

Control freaks usually make people around them very unhappy.

He's a victim of his own success.

She's a victim of her own success.

Does your wife know?

There's only one explanation.

You should have thought of that before you got her pregnant.

It's a thing which you use when you watch films.

You do know it makes no sense.

So, my enemy, I won't let you attempt on the holy of holies of my heart, you will pay for it, I promise.

I just gave my viewpoint, why are you attacking me like this?

The history of some words is a real masterpiece. For instance, kaput. The original word was the Latin "caput" - "a head"; and the way from "a head" to "the end of everything" is rather long.

They don't seem to be very pleased.

Can he swim? Sure! Tom was the best swimmer of our class, and knowing him I don't think he lost a bit of his skill.

Time has come to admit that hard work and hope are no substitute for actual knowledge.

Driver fatigue is a major cause of car accidents.

Tom couldn't get his car insured because he had had six accidents in three years, all of which had been his fault.

He's keen on sports.

My pain is excruciating.

One more word, and you're dead!

One day I added a sentence in Esperanto and someone told me it wasn't what a native speaker would say.

The English articles are bread-and-butter important. For instance, if I ask my English friend to hold my bag for a while, and then ask to give it back by saying "Give me bag", he'll probably steal the bag of the man standing around because he didn't understand which bag was meant.

At least you slept.

To my surprise, since Tatoeba has been back up, nobody has made any corrections to my sentences. Either my English has rapidly improved and I now produce good sentences only, which is way doubtful, or the users have simply decided to leave me alone and let me write whatever comes to my mind.

I have to recognize the source of your quotations.

A bomb from the time of World War II has exploded at a building site in Germany, killing at least one person.

Why is it so?

How do we draw this conclusion?

Everything is ruined because of you.

I miss you like the deserts miss the rain.

I miss you like the deserts miss the rain.

My whole body is black and blue.

Using Tatoeba you can learn languages.

I don't even know how to respond to that.

The future of mankind rests in your hands.

I was looking for Tom, but Tom found me first.
